<!-- Reflection

What didn't go well?

Pichi: We were stuck in one task, but that was also a good thing in some ways because we could get on with it and didn't have to spend time explaining to someone else where we were up to.
Tai: It was helpful that Gavin was able to walk us through the steps and help us understand but then Gavin didn't get a chance to do as much programming.
Gavin: It would have helped to swap roles and get a chance to do something different.
Caroline: Yes, people missed out on having different experiences.
Pichi and Tai: It was really helpful that Gavin was outside of the coding and jumped in to help but he didn't get to do as much actual coding.

Pichi: How did everyone feel about not working as a democracy/working for the greater good?
Caroline: I liked how it went and thought we worked well as a team.
Tai: We did sort of do a democracy but everyone had a chance to add their ideas.
Pichi: There was a consensus, we all reached a consensual agreement.
Gavin: Some of the best groups I have worked in have been one person taking the lead and telling the others what to do, but still letting people step up and voice disagreements.
Tai: We worked well as a tieam but maybe not everyone got what they wanted out of the project.

What did go well?

Pichi: Communication.
Tai: How Gavin lead the team and explained stuff when we had questions.
Caroline: We didn't follow the same style as the other teams with writing out our plan on boards but we still covered all the same points they did and it went well. It was good that we did different branches.
Gavin: The merge conflicts we had were minor and easy to resolve.

What will you focus on next time?

Caroline: Remember the time limits and that we need to be done by 3pm cause that caught me by surprise!
Pichi: Work on more uncomfortable areas rather than in an areas we already know.
Tai: I felt like I took a backseat sometimes in this project and felt a bit left out at times. In the future I want to step forward more and be more involved.
Gavin: I took a literal backseat with this project and in the future would encourage people to swap roles more and be uncomfortable.
Caroline: I agree, definitely more switching of roles.  -->
